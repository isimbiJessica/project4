        <h1>ABOUT PIZZA</h1>
        <p>Pizza history is very interesting. <br>The actual word “pizza” was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta,<br> Italy, and successively in different<br> 
            parts of Central and South Italy.<br>  While pizza has been eaten in Italy for <br>centuries, it was not until after<br> World War II and when pizza became<br>
             popular in America, that it became really<br> popular in Italy.n one of its <br>many forms, pizza has been a basic part<br> of the Italian diet since the Stone Age<br>.  This earliest form of pizza was a crude <br>
             bread that was baked beneath the stones of the fire.<br> 
              After cooking, it was seasoned with a <br>
             variety of different toppings and used instead <br>of plates and utensils to sop up broth or gravies. <br> It is said that the idea of using bread as a plate came from the Greeks who ate flat<br> round bread (plankuntos) baked with<br>
              an assortment of toppings . <br>It was eaten by the working man and his family <br>
             because it was a thrifty and convenient food.<br>
             The pizza actually could have been invented by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, Romans, or anyone who learned the secret of mixing flour with water and heating it on a hot stone.</p>
